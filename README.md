A small suite of functions for calculating information entropy based measurements.

A core concept in machine learning and data science is information entropy. It's important when working with algorithms such as C4.5, ID3 etc.
The functions have been carefully implemented following a TDD style and auto-generated documentation is available in the documentation folder.
